# Pizza_Bill_Calculator
Attached is a quick project i built by myself to calculate the total Bill for a pizza delivery. 

It is meant to test and practice my knowledge of if/else statements and logical operators in python. 

Feel free to give me a shout of something doesn't make sense or you'd like more clarification :).

GO Python!
